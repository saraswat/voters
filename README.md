# CampaignSupport -- working with voter lists

Code intended to support cleaning voter list data obtained from the Putnam County (NY) Board of Elections.

Text extracted from pdf obtained from Robert Ferguson using Apache Tika.

# TODO

1. Figure out format in which data is to be kept. Probably a mongo db instance.
2. Figure out how to support multiple (authenticated) users adding (named, dated) comments to the records.
3. Figure out a UI for users on phones and laptops to query and update the database.
